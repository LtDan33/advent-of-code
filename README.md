# advent-of-code

Test bed for the advent of codes days. This will be a quick and dirty implementation of the solutions. Will be taking a pretty naive approach on these and not planning to make anything that resembles production code. The end result is all that matters.

Jupyter Notebooks seem like a good tool for something like this so will be using those until I can't.
